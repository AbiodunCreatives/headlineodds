# Headline Odds — X Thread

## Post 1/8 — HOOK

I've been reading the news wrong my entire life.

Every headline hits the same. High confidence. No context.

But some things are 85% likely to happen. Others are 12%.

What if you could see the difference — while you read?

That's what we built. 🧵

> Screenshot of Reuters or NYT in Chrome with the extension active. Show 3–4 headlines in a list, each with a visible green pill — odds varying across them (e.g. 72¢ yes, 89¢ yes, 41¢ yes). Include the full browser chrome so the URL bar (reuters.com) is visible. Dark mode browser. Landscape, wide crop at 1200×675px. No annotations — the product speaks for itself.

## Post 2/8 — THE PROBLEM

Think about the last big headline you read.

"Fed signals rate cut"
"Bitcoin could hit $200k"
"Trump to sign sweeping executive order"

Each one sounds equally certain.

But the market has a completely different view on each.

You're reading without the full picture.

## Post 3/8 — THE SOLUTION

Headline Odds is a free Chrome extension.

It puts real-time prediction market odds next to every headline you read.

Not a poll. Not an analyst's opinion.

Real money probabilities from thousands of people betting on the outcome — right there on the page.

## Post 4/8 — HOW IT WORKS

Here's how it works:

① Install the extension (free, no account needed)
② Browse Reuters, NYT, Bloomberg — wherever you read
③ A green pill appears next to matched headlines → 72¢ yes
④ Click it: full Yes/No prices, volume, and close date

Nothing changes about how you browse. You just see more.

> **IMAGE 2**
> Same news site, but click one pill so the market card is fully expanded and visible. The headline it's attached to should be readable above the card. The card should clearly show: "ODDS ON THIS STORY" header, the market question, green Yes row (e.g. 72¢) and red No row (28¢), volume ($1.2M), close date, and the "𝕏 Share these odds" button at the bottom. Crop to show the headline + open card together. 1200×675px.

## Post 5/8 — CREDIBILITY

The odds come from Kalshi.

The only federally regulated prediction market in the US —
designated by the CFTC, same standing as the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.

Not vibes. Not sentiment.

Real money from real people with skin in the game.

Prediction markets have beaten expert forecasts. Repeatedly.

## Post 6/8 — FOR EVERYONE

Doesn't matter what vertical you're in:

📈 Finance — Fed rates, inflation, earnings
🗳️ Politics — Elections, bills, executive orders
₿ Crypto — BTC levels, ETF decisions
🌍 Geopolitics — Trade wars, sanctions, conflicts
⚡ Energy — Oil prices, climate policy

If it makes headlines, there's probably a market on it.

## Post 7/8 — THE DEEPER POINT

Here's what nobody talks about:

Headlines are written with equal confidence regardless of probability.

"Might happen" reads the same as "definitely happening."

Once you start reading with odds attached, you can't go back.

You stop reacting to news.

You start thinking in probabilities.

> Find a real headline on a news site where the amber ⚡ pill fires — a confident headline using language like "confirmed", "set to pass", "will sign" — where the Kalshi market is below 40¢. Capture the amber glowing pill next to the headline. Then click it so the card opens showing the amber "⚡ Market disagrees with this headline" banner at the top of the card, with the Yes price (low, e.g. 28¢) clearly visible. Crop to show the headline, amber pill, and open card together. 1200×675px. This is the most shareable visual in the thread.

> Clean browser screenshot of headlineodds.fun — the hero section above the fold only. Set browser viewport to exactly 1280px wide in DevTools before screenshotting. Should show the headline "The news, with the odds.", the hero subtext, the "Request Early Access →" button, and the animated demo card on the right with green pills visible.
